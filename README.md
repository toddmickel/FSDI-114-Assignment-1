# FSDI 114 - Assignment 1

## Anagrams

> Two words are anagrams of each other if they have the same number of characters (letters) and use all of the same letters.
>
> For example: star and rats are anagrams of each other because they are of the same length and use all the same letters, the same number of times.
>
> Another example is cars and scar. Note again that they not only use the same letters but they use these letters the same amount of times.
>
> Your function must take two strings and return "True" if they are anagrams of each other; False otherwise.
>
> Your solution must ignore casing (upper, lower) and spaces such that "I am lord voldemort" is found to be an anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle".
